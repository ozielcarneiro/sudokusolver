Sudoku Solver program in Java with Swing GUI.

Current version is solves puzzles algorithmically by identifying positions in the puzzle that have only one possible value given the already known puzzle configuration. This means that this solver is not able to handle situations where the complete solution requires the solver to take a guess in between more than one value.

The GUI is easy to use. To alter the value in each position of the grid, click on it. The value will turn blue indicating it is selected for alterations. To input a new value simply type the new value. Once the value is altered simply click in a new position to alter a different position, or reclick on the selected position to deselect the position. To solve the puzzle click in "Solve". To clear the grid click in "Clear".
