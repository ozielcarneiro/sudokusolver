Sudoku Solver program in Java with Swing GUI.

Current version solves puzzles through a combination of an algorithmic solution and depth first search. The algorithm first looks to identify positions in the puzzle that have only one possible value given the already known puzzle configuration. Once the empty locations on the board can be filled with more than one value, the algorithm looks for values that can only be inserted in on location within a row, a column or a quadrant. If both of these methods fail to produce any change, a depth first search is applied to the location with less possible values, forcing an update of the puzzle. To improve the overall run time and avoid extended use of DFS everytime there is a change of value in the puzzle, the algorithmic solution checks for more trivialities.

The GUI is easy to use. To alter the value in each position of the grid, click on it. The value will turn blue indicating it is selected for alterations. To input a new value simply type the new value. Once the value is altered simply click in a new position to alter a different position, or reclick on the selected position to deselect the position. To solve the puzzle click in "Solve". To clear the grid click in "Clear".
